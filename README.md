# R1-Race-predication

# Overview
This study focuses on predicting F1 race outcomes using various machine learning models. We begin by merging multiple data files, conducting data cleaning, feature selection, data transformation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and applying six machine learning models for classification. The target variable is the race outcome (win or no win), based on driver performance and race characteristics.
